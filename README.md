## Description

Visualizing data is a crucial step in analyzing and exploring data. During the last
two decades the statistical programming language R has become a major tool for data
analyses and visualization across different fields of science. However, creating figures
ready for scientific publication can be a tricky and time consuming task.
The oceanmap package provides some helpful functions to facilitate and optimize the
visualization of geographic and oceanographic data, such as satellite and bathymetric
data sets.

## Key Features

* *plotmap()*, *ggplotmap()* and *ggplotmaply()* to plot (interactive) land masks

* *get.bathy()* to download bathymetric data from the NOAA ETOPO1 database

* *set.colorbar()* to define the colorbar (position, ticks, colormap) in base-plots (like plotmap)

* *v()*, an optimized base-plot tool for creating image or contour plots from different data formats
(matrix, array, raster, netcdf, binary)

* *figure()*, to facilitate resizing and saving of figures in diverse formats (jpeg, png,
eps, pdf and eps)

* *cmap*, a data set with several colormaps for oceanographic data

These functions were written in a way that they do not require a large amount of their
numerous arguments to be specified but still return nice plots that are ready for publication.

## Credits

This package was developed during my PhD thesis at the [IFREMER](\link{https://wwz.ifremer.fr/) and a Postdoc at [IRD](https://www.ird.fr/), which are both part of the [MARBEC lab](http://www.umr-marbec.fr). A ggplot-version of plotmap has been added since.
